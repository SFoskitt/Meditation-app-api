## Setup and Installation - Instructions for Developers
To use the program locally, fork and clone the repo. 

- Install dependencies with `bundle install`
- Start Postgres with `psql -U postgres`
- Run Rake db tasks 
- Start server with `rails server`

## Development process
I began the development process by creating a wireframe, an ERB, and user stories for the app I'd envisioned. Coding started by creating the back end, and then continued with the front end client. The api was built on top of a General Assembly template that included User table and authentication. I created a Records table to store date and time of each practice, length of the session, and user feedback on how the session went. I scaffolded these resources, tested end points with curl scripts, updated resource controllers with inheritance, and added relationships between the tables.

## Future directions
In the future, this backend will expand to allow for increased functionality:
- Settings preferences, such as selecting alarm sounds and setting a pre-practice timer (to prepare for the practice)
- Ability to add a username
- Option to add a profile picture
- Ability to track profile data such as usage and practice statistics
